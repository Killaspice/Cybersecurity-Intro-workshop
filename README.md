Fear, urgency, greed

Why it works?
Emotions supersede common sense. Humans feel emotions first before logic.


HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)

HTTPS(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)
- More and more phishing websites have https though

Firefox would have warned not the phishing site is not secure

How to be more careful?
- slow down
- use antivirus, firewall
- ZERO TRUST POLICY - even if it seems like someone you know
- bookmark legit sites you use


What is IP Address:
- It's your device's unique ID on the web
- Internet Protocol Address (version4 - IPv4). It's a rule to locate a device on a network
- eg. 192.168.10.1
- 4 blocks of numbers separated by a period.
- How many permutations/total number of IP address? 256x256x256x256 = 4.29 billion
- Total human population - 8.1bil
- IPv4 Exhaustion - we officially ran out of IPv4 in 2011

How we address shortage problem?
- IPv6 - XXXX : XXXX : XXXX : XXXX: XXXX: XXXX:  XXXX: XXXX:
- 8 Blocks. 340 trillion

How do we deal with the lack of IPv4?
Division of internal and external IP address
- Interval vs External IP/ Private vs Public IP
