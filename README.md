Fear, urgency, greed

Why it works?
Emotions supersede common sense. Humans feel emotions first before logic.


HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)

HTTPS(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure)
- More and more phishing websites have https though

Firefox would have warned not the phishing site is not secure

How to be more careful?
- slow down
- use antivirus, firewall
- ZERO TRUST POLICY - even if it seems like someone you know
- bookmark legit sites you use


What is IP Address:
- It's your device's unique ID on the web
- Internet Protocol Address (version4 - IPv4). It's a rule to locate a device on a network
- eg. 192.168.10.1
- 4 blocks of numbers separated by a period.
- How many permutations/total number of IP address? 256x256x256x256 = 4.29 billion
- Total human population - 8.1bil
- IPv4 Exhaustion - we officially ran out of IPv4 in 2011

How we address shortage problem?
- IPv6 - XXXX : XXXX : XXXX : XXXX: XXXX: XXXX:  XXXX: XXXX:
- 8 Blocks. 340 trillion

How do we deal with the lack of IPv4?
Division of internal and external IP address
- Interval vs External IP/ Private vs Public IP

External IP address
- external IP address is leased to you by ISP
- used for communication on the internet


How do we differentiate between internal and external addresses?

192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 number range has been reserved for internal network/usage only
10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 number range also reserved for internal usage
- but you only see that at like big offices with a lot of devices


Shodan can collect unsecured webcamera data, paid accounts can see

How to know if webcam you buy is secure? check model and version

How to protect ourselves? 
- Good password hygiene
  1. use a different password for every account
  2. use a STRONG password - 13 or more characters
  3. Avoid modification of KNOWN words - eg. Password = P@s$w0rd!
  4. use password generator
  5. How to rmb? Use a password manager
  6. change password regularly (maybe yearly, but best is every few months)

What to do if password have been breached?
1. change the password, not same as previous ones
2. check if other info have been leaked


What is Stenography?
- Concept: Hiding data in the 2nd layer of another file


What is Kali Linus?
- It is an OS, designed for Digital Forensics(blue team) and Penetration testing(Red team)
- 

folder = directory

What is SSH?
- Secure SHell - allows us to connect to another computer via the terminal located somewhere else. You only see terminal. It is NOT Remote Desktop Protocol


What is BASH?
- BASH is a shell, it is a language used to interact with the system
- Why BASH?
  1. user-friendly
  2. linux friendly

Basic BASH Commands
1. clear or ctrl+L
2. pwd - print working directory/your location
- we are at home folder of user cew140424@ubuntu-CEW in the exercise
3. wget - download a file from the site given

Sometimes our terminal will hang because of an incomplete command. Hit ctrl+c to end process and start again (ctrl + c shows as ^C)
